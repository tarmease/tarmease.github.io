                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Tarmease ("we," "us," or "our"). We operate the Tarmease chatbot and associated services (the "Service"), accessible via the Facebook Messenger Platform and our website at <a href="https://www.tarmease.com" class="text-secondary hover:underline">https://www.tarmease.com</a>.</p>
                <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights in relation to that data. This policy applies to all information collected through our chatbot, website, and any related services, sales, marketing, or events.</p>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-secondary mb-1">Important Notice Regarding Facebook Messenger:</p>
                    <p class="text-sm">When you interact with Tarmease via Facebook Messenger, you are also subject to Meta Platforms, Inc.'s ("Meta") Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We process data sent to us by Meta to provide our conversational service to you. While we control the data we collect, Meta independently controls the data processed within its own platform infrastructure.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect information that allows us to operate the Tarmease chatbot, facilitate interactive experiences, and provide customer support. The types of personal information we collect depend on your interactions with us and the choices you make.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-dark mt-6">2.1 Information Provided by Meta (Facebook)</h3>
                <p>When you initiate a conversation with us on Facebook Messenger, or when you interact with our Facebook Page, Meta provides us with specific information through their API to enable the service:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Page Scoped ID (PSID):</strong> A unique, tokenized identifier assigned to your conversation with our specific Page. This allows us to distinguish your session from others and maintain conversation history. It does not provide us with direct access to your external public profile URL or private account details unless you voluntarily provide them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> Depending on your Facebook privacy settings and the specific interactions you have with our bot, we may access public profile fields such as your first name, last name, profile picture, locale (language preference), time zone, and gender. We use this strictly to personalize our communication (e.g., addressing you by name or adjusting the language).</li>
                    <li><strong>Message Content:</strong> We collect and store the text, images, audio, attachments, and quick-reply selections you send to us in the chat.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-dark mt-6">2.2 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
                <p>We collect information you explicitly provide during the conversation to fulfill specific requests, including:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Contact Details:</strong> Email address, phone number, or physical address (e.g., if you provide these for order shipping or human support follow-up).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> Details regarding bookings, orders, or specific service inquiries made through the bot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Service Data:</strong> Details of inquiries, complaints, or feedback you submit.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-dark mt-6">2.3 Automatically Collected Technical Data</h3>
                <p>When you visit our website or interact with our webhook endpoints via Messenger, we and our infrastructure providers (such as Cloudflare) may collect certain technical data automatically:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Device and Connection Data:</strong> Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Logs:</strong> Timestamps of messages, interaction metrics, and error logs used for debugging and security purposes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</p>
                <p>We use the information we collect or receive for the following purposes:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>To Facilitate the Chatbot Service (Contractual Necessity):</strong> We use your PSID and message content to generate automated responses, maintain conversation history (context), and execute commands you request (e.g., "Check my order status"). This is the core function of the application.</li>
                    <li><strong>To Provide Customer Support (Legitimate Interest):</strong> We use your message history and contact details to resolve technical issues, answer questions, or respond to your inquiries.</li>
                    <li><strong>To Send Administrative Information (Legitimate Interest):</strong> We may send you notifications regarding your account, product updates, or changes to our terms and policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>To Enforce Terms and Policies (Legal Obligation):</strong> We process data to ensure compliance with Meta’s Platform Terms, prevent abuse (such as spam or harassment), and protect the integrity of our service.</li>
                    <li><strong>To Improve Our Services (Legitimate Interest):</strong> We analyze aggregated, anonymized usage data to understand how users interact with our bot, improve its accuracy, and optimize user experience.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Restrictions on Advertising:</strong> We do not sell your personal data to third parties. Furthermore, consistent with Meta's Platform Terms, we do not use data obtained from the Facebook Messenger API for advertising creative or direct marketing without your explicit, separate consent.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
                <p>We only share information with the following categories of third parties under specific conditions:</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-dark mt-6">4.1 Service Providers (Data Processors)</h3>
                <p>We utilize trusted third-party vendors to operate our infrastructure. These vendors are contractually bound to protect your data and only process it according to our instructions.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Cloudflare, Inc. (USA/Global):</strong> We use Cloudflare Workers and D1 Storage to host our application logic and database. Cloudflare acts as our data processor, providing secure hosting, encryption at rest, and DDoS protection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google LLC (USA):</strong> We may use Google Workspace (e.g., Sheets/Docs) for internal data management or support ticket logging. Google processes this data under strict enterprise confidentiality terms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-dark mt-6">4.2 Legal Obligations</h3>
                <p>We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-dark mt-6">4.3 Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such an event, we will ensure the successor entity is bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">5. International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>Our servers and third-party service providers (like Cloudflare and Google) are located in the United States and potentially other countries via distributed global networks. If you are accessing our services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties in countries that may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.</p>
                <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland: We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These include implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers, which require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">6. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Conversation Logs:</strong> We retain chat history for a period of up to 12 months to provide consistent customer support and context for returning users. After this period, data is either deleted or anonymized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Logs:</strong> Infrastructure logs (IP addresses, request headers) are retained for 30 days for security auditing and then deleted.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-8">7. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> User data stored in our databases (Cloudflare D1) is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 algorithms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All communications between your device, Meta's servers, and our servers are secured via Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) to prevent interception.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We strictly limit access to personal data to authorized personnel who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
                </ul>
